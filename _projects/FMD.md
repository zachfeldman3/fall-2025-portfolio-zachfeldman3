# Fluid Mechanical Dissection 

### Speaker Dissection Project — My Role and CAD Contribution

Our speaker dissection project was a fully collaborative effort in which our group worked together to understand how a standard consumer speaker converts electrical input into acoustic output. As a team, we opened the enclosure, documented every component, and analyzed how the diaphragm, coil, magnet, vent, and internal air cavity interact to generate sound. We collectively created the final video, performed the physical dissection, measured key dimensions, and applied MAE 3230 fluid mechanics concepts—such as compressible flow behavior and acoustic wave propagation—to explain how the device operates. All observations and visuals were compiled into our storyboard and presentation materials.

My individual contribution focused specifically on **creating the CAD model of the speaker diaphragm** which is shown below I modeled the diaphragm based on our measurements and photos, ensuring that the curved conical geometry, mounting rim, and depth profile were accurately represented. This CAD was important because the diaphragm is the primary interface between mechanical motion and the surrounding air: its oscillation produces the alternating compression and rarefaction regions that form sound waves. By modeling it digitally, I helped the team visualize how the shape of the diaphragm affects airflow direction, pressure distribution, and acoustic efficiency. The CAD model also allowed us to highlight how even small geometric details—like curvature continuity and edge thickness—influence the way air accelerates and how effectively energy is transferred from the electromechanical system into the fluid domain.

As part of the group, I contributed to the analysis, discussions, and video assembly, but my main technical responsibility was accurately recreating the diaphragm geometry so we could better understand and communicate its fluid-mechanical role within the full speaker system.
